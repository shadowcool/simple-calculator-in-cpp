# Simple-Calculator-In-CPP
A Simple Calculator Made with the help of C++

This Calculator can Take Input of Calculation Method and Input of 2 Numbers.

## CPP Setup

To setup this code you will need a compiler and the C++ Extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace for Errors and Debugging.

For the compiler I used G++ which is similar to GCC. You can download it through [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org).

## Running the Code

After a Compiler is installed you will need to run the following commands in the console.

```bash
g++ {name of your file}.cpp
./a
```
